# Change Calendar <span class="badge badge-danger badge-outlined" title="Enterprise Edition">EE</span>

The Change Calendar feature is able to manage your infrastructure changes directly in openITCOCKPIT. Plan the relocation of servers, the upgrade of services and much more directly in openITCOCKPIT and keep everything centrally in one view. The organisation of the changes takes place in another tool? No problem! The openITCOCKIT Change Calendar is able to import changes as a CSV file.

## CLI import

There is also the possibility to import the changes using CSV files.

For a successful import the CSV files need the following informations:
```
UID,Calendar,Start,End,Title,Description,Context
```

An example file could look like this:

```
UID,Calendar,Start,End,Title,Description,Context
"ACTE000001","Another Calendar","2023-09-10T14:00:00+00:00","2023-09-10T15:00:00+00:00","Test Import Command One","Description of the imported event.","[{'name': 'A custom field',	'value': 'Test value. It is an error. Please hold the line.', 'class': 'danger'}]"
"ACTE000002","Another Calendar","2023-09-10T14:00:00+00:00","2023-09-10T15:00:00+00:00","Test Import Command Two","Yes, this is also a description.","[{ 'name': 'A custom field', 'value': 'Test value. It was working but with warnings.', 'class': 'warning'}]"
"ACTE000003","Another Calendar","2023-09-10T14:00:00+00:00","2023-09-10T15:00:00+00:00","Test Import Command Three","Aaaaand another description for an imported event.","[{ 'name': 'A custom field', 'value': 'Three is a charm. Now it is working properly.', 'class': 'success'}]"

oitc ChangecalendarModule.Import -f /tmp/kalender.csv
```

!!! info "Hint"
    The imported file will remain untouched. It is only read during import and not synchronized with existing events.

!!! warning "Hint"
    The import file has an additional field which is used to identify an event uniquely. In this case, an existing event will be updated during import.
