# System health user notification
Users can be notified by openITCOCKPIT by e-mail as soon as the system health of openITCOCKPIT changes.
To do this, open the system health menu, which is hidden in the header behind the heart symbol, and press the blue button with the user symbol.

The overview will then appear. All users who receive an e-mail notification when their status changes can be viewed there.
This item can also be accessed via the side menu under "System tools" -> "System health notification list".
